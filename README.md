# ENVS-193DS_homework-Limon-Benise

General information: This code is a linear model and regression analysis to understand if fish length does predict fish weight for trout perch across all sample years.

Data and file overview: The data is of different kinds of fish and different factors about them such as length, weight, geography, sex, etc. 

Sharing and access information: You can find this at https://github.com/beniselimon/ENVS-193DS_homework-Limon-Benise.git. 

Methodological information: Data are collected annually to enable us to track the fish assemblages of eleven primary lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, bog lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog], Mendota, Monona, Wingra and Fish). Sampling on Lakes Monona, Wingra, and Fish started in 1995
